This is William Anderson's personal bash.

Ive collected and added bits throughout the years. This is for my personal use but if you find anything helpful, feel free to take it.

### disclaimer
As Ive taken bits throughout the years and from colleages profiles Im not sure if things here are stolen multiple generations ago or where from.
git completion is definitely stolen
